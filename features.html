                        of other genres into legal troubles. This culture, which has been around for decades, was
                        nurtured by the act of sample snitching unintentionally in the midst of online chatter and
                        community interaction. Sample snitching is where users publicly indentify and discuss unlicensed
                        samples that can potentially get their favourite producer at risk. Especially so if they've used
                        an unlicensed sample.
