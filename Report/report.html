<h2>Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to
    implement.</h2>
My site, MusicMag, is a website featuring news related to music, highlighting events relating to music producers, as
well as DJs. The structure being used in my website features a hierarchical model, where navigation is easy, and news
are presented in a logical order.

<br>

<h2>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include guest speakers, other
    websites, artists, developers etc.</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        One artist that have inspired me in creating my website is a DJ known as Martin Garrix. In 2018 he released a
        book featuring a hectic life as a producer/DJ and seeing the experiences recounted I would like to create a
        website that features this slice of life instead of that of mainstream musicians, making this website a source
        of news for uprising producers and DJs to stay up to date in this niche community.
    </li>
    <li>
        A website that inspired me when making my website is Apple’s website. (www.apple.com) Apple’s home page features
        a promotional video that features a modern and sleek design which I found to be very applicable towards building
        the theme of my webpage featuring music technology news.
    </li>
    <li>
        Another website that inspired me when making my website is Pitchfork’s website. (www.pitchfork.com) . The layout
        and overall design of Pitchfork’s video webpage was very modern and elegant when presenting music related news
        videos, inspiring the layout design for my video webpage.
    </li>
</ol>

<br>

<h2>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Alt Text in Images: This allows my images to be accessible to visually disabled users who use screen readers.
    </li>
    <li>
        High Color Contrast: This allows my images to be accessible to visually impaired users that have low color
        contrast sensitivity.
    </li>
    <li>
        Keyboard friendly: Website functionalities can be accessed with only the keyboard, accessible use for users
        using assistive technologies, which relies on keyboard-only navigation.
    </li>
</ol>

<br>

<h2>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Maintaining a good user interface for all devices: By doing so, the user experience from various devices will
        not be compromised.
    </li>
    <li>
        Content usability : Graphic and content is carefully balanced with the right combinations and allows users a
        smooth and easy experience browsing through the contents of the site.
    </li>
    <li>
        Maintaining a clear and organized page layout: A clear and organised layout prevents the user from getting lost
        in browsing and maintains an easy navigational experience.
    </li>
</ol>

<br>

<h2>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that (i.e.
    what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular
    resource to make it work with your site).</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        How to make a carousel – I learnt how to make an automatic carousel by looking up tutorials on W3Schools that
        demonstrates this. I made certain changes with regards to the HTML class names, CSS selectors, as well as
        properties that they have used in consideration of fitting it to my website. Certain considerations include
        potentially reusing the slideshow in another aspect of the site/webpage and potential validation issues when
        implemented into the scale of my website.
    </li>
    <li>
        Design considerations for a responsive mobile experience. I had to learn certain mobile considerations for the
        website to make it functional as well as accessible. Many layout changes had to be implemented while loads of
        bugs popped up along the way of designing the layout for different viewports. I had to look up specific inquires
        that were like mine on StackOverflow.
    </li>
    <li>
        Debugging. One of the tools I learnt is creating a menu selection experience for mobile. This includes creating
        animations on clicking on the menu button as well as allowing click and touch events without interfering with
        each other on such a viewport. This was mostly learnt from W3Schools through creating a drop-down menu and
        StackOverflow when touch and click events clashed. I had to look up general debugging issues and solutions on
        StackOverflow. I spent alot more time debugging the website and cleaning the
        code compared to actually making the website. Debugging is an important skill to get right and can make the
        difference between a smooth and disrupting user experience.
    </li>
</ol>

<br>

<h2>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and users. That is, how to adjust the menu using CSS and JS to
    fit the mobile viewport experience why?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Layout Design - I believed the layout design of the website was implemented well. Navigation on the site is
        clear and the order of elements in the webpage is well organized. The planning of the wireframes into the given
        class names for CSS layout designing was smooth, well executed and thought out.
    </li>
    <li>
        Incorporating responsiveness into the design – I believe the implementation of webpage responsiveness was done
        well in this design. Layout of the webpage was accounted for varying widths of the viewport and the typography
        was well accounted so that it is easily readable on different screens.
    </li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</h2>
Planning was not as smooth as I expected – While the planning of the wireframes and mockup leading to the actual site
building was smooth, more and more features unaccounted for in the design planning came up along the way to be
implemented. This was in part due to the complexity of the website that I had planned out. This led to some bugs that
took me hours to resolve, as well as some critical issues that resulted in semi-huge overhauls in the implementation of
the code. This highlights some of the flaws in my planning towards building the webpage. When I do get to plan out a
website another time, I may consider the planning of the wireframes and code implementation in a way where the structure
is easily scalable towards new features and functionalities so that huge issues will not occur.
